Semantic vector validation (THIS IS BIG)
Camera orientation / plane normal / cylinder axis
Each component in range [-1, 1]
Vector must NOT be (0,0,0)
Vector must be normalized (length ≈ 1)
sqrt(x*x + y*y + z*z) ≈ 1


B️⃣ Missing validations (should fix)
6. Normal / axis vectors are not checked for zero vector ⚠️
if (vec.x == 0.0 && vec.y == 0.0 && vec.z == 0.0)
	parse_error(EXIT_FAILURE, "Vector cannot be 0,0,0");
